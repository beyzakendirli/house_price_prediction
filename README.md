# Multiple Linear Regression Best Practice: House Price Prediction

Hello, my name is Beyza. Recently, I trained a model to predict the price of a house by using MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) technique. 

(File Descriptions)
This repository contains my codes, the libraries which I used and my Medium blog post.
House Price Prediction V4.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis.
data.csv: Dataset that I worked on.

(Installations)
I downloaded the house price prediction dataset from Kaggle > https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata 

(Libraries)
Please reach out the libraries which have been used below: 
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error

(Medium Blog Posts)
Please reach out the Medium blog posts which I shared my experince as best practice:

(Project Motivation)
My main motivation for the project is to train my first prediction model and gain data science experience with hands on practice.

I have answered these questions below:
1) What percentage of the houses have been renovated?
2) Does renovation has a big impact on the condition of a house?
3) How many households are using more than half of their land as living space and what is the percentage?
