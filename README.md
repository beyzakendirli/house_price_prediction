# Multiple Linear Regression Best Practice: House Price Prediction

Hello, my name is Beyza. Recently, I trained a model to predict the price of a house by using MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) technique. 
This repository contains my codes, the libraries which I used and my Medium blog post.

Please reach out the libraries which have been used below:
import pandas as pd \n
import numpy as np \n
import seaborn as sns \n
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression \n
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split \n
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error \n

Please reach out the Medium blog post which I shared my experince as best practice:

My main motivation for the project is to train my first prediction model and gain data science experience with hands on practice.
